## Why this Site?

- Welcome to my corner of the internet! This blog serves as a platform for me to share my thoughts with the world. You'll find posts primarily focused on computer science topics that interest me or that I'm currently exploring.
- One cool thing about this site? It's powered by GitHub Pages, which means it's completely free to host! And the content is written in markdown.
